## Terminology




I dont know how to categorize this. So let the word vomit begin 

Jumpmind commerce supports a promotion database that allows for the unique configuration of qualification item to rewards. Each Reward can have an unlimited amount of qualification items that permit that rewrd to take effect. 
For example, to get 50% off of a POP item you would need to buy the item that has the product ID of POP40716, POP36675, POP40718, POP36666, etc. 
Within this example the promotion is a 505 off of a pop item, the qualification is that it as to have a certian product ID, and the reward is 50% off of the item
